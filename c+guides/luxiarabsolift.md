## Guide
### Things you'll need:
- Lifts to monitor
- [Luxiar Absolift](https://roblox.com/library/4969673618)

### Step 1: Setup
To start, insert the Absolift model into the game.


### Step 2: Navigate to LiftModel value.
Navigate to your LiftModel value within the Absolift.

{: .highlight }
> This is located under `[Absolift Model] > Screen > Display > LiftA > LiftModel` for Lift A.

### Step 3: Select lift.
Within the Explorer, find the lift you wish to monitor.

Click on the `Value` property of `LiftModel`, then click on the lift **in the explorer**.

If done correctly, the `Value` property should now show the name of your lift.

For lifts in a Multibay setup, it is the same process.、

**That's it!**
Test the game to check if it functions as intended.

## Additional Configuration
### Change display name of lift on Absolift Monitor
Navigate into `[Absolift Model] > Screen > Display > Lift_ > Stats > LiftLabel` and edit the `Text` property.

### Absolift Monitor off on game start
Navigate to `[Absolift Model] > IsOn` and **uncheck** the `Value` property.

Then, navigate to `[Absolift Model] > Screen > Display` and uncheck the `Enabled` property.
